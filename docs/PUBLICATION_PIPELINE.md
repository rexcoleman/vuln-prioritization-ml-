> **Authority Hierarchy**
>
> | Priority | Document | Role |
> |----------|----------|------|
> | Tier 1 | `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` | Primary spec — highest authority |
> | Tier 2 | `null # No external FAQ` | Clarifications — cannot override Tier 1 |
> | Tier 3 | `docs/ADVERSARIAL_EVALUATION.md` | Advisory only — non-binding if inconsistent with Tier 1/2 |
> | Contract | This document | Implementation detail — subordinate to all tiers above |
>
> **Conflict rule:** When a higher-tier document and this contract disagree, the higher tier wins.
> Update this contract via `CONTRACT_CHANGE` or align implementation to the higher tier.

## 2) Content Identity

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Working title** | {{BLOG_TITLE}} |
| **Content pillar** | {{CONTENT_PILLAR}} |
| **Target audience** | {{TARGET_AUDIENCE}} |
| **One-line thesis** | *(What is the single insight a reader walks away with?)* |

### Voice Check

This post MUST pass the builder-voice test:

| Test | Pass? |
|------|-------|
| References something you built (not theoretical) | [ ] |
| Shows work (code, architecture, data) not just opinions | [ ] |
| Avoids "5 Tips" / "Why You Should" / "The Future of" framing | [ ] |
| Includes at least one architecture diagram | [ ] |
| Links to a GitHub repo with working code | [ ] |

---

## 3) Draft Structure

| # | Section | Content | Estimated Length | Status |
|---|---------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | Hook | Problem statement — why this matters, in 2-3 sentences | 2-3 sentences | |
| 2 | Context | What you built, what tools/frameworks you used, why this approach | 1 paragraph | |
| 3 | Architecture | System-level diagram + explanation of key design decisions | 1-2 paragraphs + diagram | |
| 4 | Key Findings | 3-5 findings with evidence (numbers, charts, code) | 3-5 subsections | |
| 5 | Code Examples | Runnable snippets that prove the claims | 2-3 code blocks | |
| 6 | What I Learned / What Broke | Honest reflection on failures and surprises | 1-2 paragraphs | |
| 7 | Conclusion + Links | Summary + links to repo, govML, related posts | 1 paragraph | |

### Architecture Diagram Requirement

Every technical post MUST include at least one architecture diagram showing system-level design. Tools: Mermaid (renders in Hugo/GitHub/dev.to), Excalidraw (hand-drawn aesthetic), or draw.io.

**Diagram captures:** *(describe what the diagram will show)*

---

## 4) Evidence Inventory

Map key claims to supporting artifacts from the project:

| Claim | Evidence | Source File / Figure |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| *(e.g., "Feature controllability enables 100% detection of noise attacks")* | *(metric, chart)* | *(FINDINGS.md §X, outputs/figures/Y.png)* |
| | | |
| | | |
